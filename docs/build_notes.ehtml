<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 2.4, 2 August 2012</h3>

This build contains two additions to marsutil(n)'s order(n) module's
[prepare] command, the -oneof and -someof options.  These allow 
[prepare] to validate that a particular parameter's value is within
a set of values, or is a subset of a set of values, where the set of
values is specified as a list rather than as the name of a validation
type.<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3607: order(n): prepare -oneof, -someof
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 2.3, 25 July 2012</h3>

This build integrates the dynaform(n)/dynaview(n) data entry form
infrastructure into Mars and specifically into
order(n)/orderdialog(n).  In addition, order(n)/orderdialog(n) are no
longer integrated with the eventq(n) mechanism; orders can no longer
be scheduled in advance.  (We've learned that that's the wrong
abstraction; orders are about user input right now.  Scheduling
applies to other entities.)<p>

In addition, there are significant updates to the cmsheet(n) module,
allowing much improved user input via a cmsheet(n).<p>

The complete set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3591: dynaform(n)/dynaview(n)
    <li> Bug 3594: dynaform(n)/order(n): Improved validation of selector cases
    <li> Bug 3595: cmsheet(n): change behavior and add -changecmd option
    <li> Bug 3598: dynaform(n) test suite
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 2.2, 2 July 2012</h3>

This build is in support of the Athena 4.0.8 Engineering Release to
TRISA. It contains the following minor change:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3580: htmlviewer(n): INPUT elements should have border: 1px.
</ul>

<h3>Build 2.1, 25 June 2012</h3>

This build contains the following changes:<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3557: sqlbrowser(n): disable column-label sorting
    <li> Bug 3565: Remove TkHTML 2.0 and related software
    <li> Bug 3566: Move htmllviewer3(n) from projectgui(n) to marsgui(n) as htmlviewer(n).
    <li> Bug 3569: Update CM plan to Mars 2.0
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.0, 21 June 2012</h3>

Build 2.0 is the first Mars 2.x build; Mars has been split, with Mars
1.x continuing to support JNEM maintenance and Mars 2.x supporting
Athena 4.0.x development.  This will allow the TkHTML 2.0 widget
currently used in Mars to be replaced by the TkHTML 3.0 widget now
used in Athena.<p>

Build 2.0 contains no changes except for those required to identify it
as Mars 2.x.  In terms of the Mars code, it is identical to Mars
1.70.<p>
