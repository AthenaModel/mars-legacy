<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 2.0, 21 June 2012</h3>

Build 2.0 is the first Mars 2.x build; Mars has been split, with Mars 1.x continuing to support JNEM
maintenance and Mars 2.x supporting Athena 4.0.x development.  This will allow the TkHTML 2.0 widget
currently used in Mars to be replaced by the TkHTML 3.0 widget now used in Athena.<p>

Build 2.0 contains no changes except for those required to identify it as Mars 2.x.  In terms of the Mars
code, it is identical to Mars 1.70.<p>
