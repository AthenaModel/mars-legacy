<<manpage {util(n) eventq(n)} "Discrete Event Queue Manager">>

<<section SYNOPSIS>>

<pre>
package require util 1.0
namespace import ::util::*
</pre>

<<itemlist>>

<<section DESCRIPTION>>

eventq(n) defines an event queue mechanism for discrete event
simulation.  The event queue manager allows the application define
an arbitrary number of simulation event types, instances of each
type may be scheduled, and executed at the appropriate time.<p>

The event queue itself is stored in an instance of
<<xref sqldocument(n)>>, which must be provided at initialization
time.<p>

<<subsection "Simulation Time">>

eventq(n) expresses simulated time in integer ticks, starting at 0.
The simulated time is updated as events execute, and is reset to 0
on <<iref restart>>.<p>

eventq(n) is designed to add discrete event simulation capability
within an existing time-step simulation.  The <<iref advance>> method
executes scheduled events up to and including a specified end time;
this can be called by the parent simulation at each time step.<p>

<b>Note</b>: eventq(n) doesn't use or advance any
<<xref simclock(n)>>; it presumes that the application will do so at
each time step.<p>

<<subsection "Event Types">>

Each event type has a name, an argument list, and a body.  The
arguments are specified when an event is scheduled; the body is
executed when the event's execution time is reached.  The arguments
are available in the body, rather like the arguments of standard Tcl
procs.<p>

<<section "DATABASE SCHEMA">>

<<swallow {
    # Define a dummy event
    ::util::eventq define dummy {a b} { ... }
}>>

eventq(n) stores the queued events in an <<xref sqldocument(n)>>;
eventq(n) is thus an <<xref sqlsection(i)>> object.  The event IDs,
execution times, and event types are stored in a single table,
<b>eventq_queue</b>.  An additional table,
<b>eventq_etype_<i>etype</i></b>, is defined for each event type;
it contains the argument values for each instance of the event
type <i>etype</i>.  Final, a view, <b>eventq_queue_<i>etype</i></b> is
define for each event type <i>etype</i>; this view joins the master
event table with the event type's argument table.<p>

It's expected that the application will query these tables to find
events of interest; further, the application is welcome to directly
update the argument values in the <b>eventq_etype_<i>etype</i></b> table.<p>

The schema looks as follows; as an example, an event type <b>dummy</b>
with arguments <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> has been defined.

<<section COMMANDS>>

<<deflist commands>>

<<defitem eventq {eventq <i>subcommand</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>>

The event queue is manipulated via the subcommands of the
<<iref eventq>> command, which are as follows:<p>

<<deflist eventq>>

<<defitem advance {eventq advance <i>max_t</i>}>>

Advances simulation time, executing all events with execution times
less than or equal to <i>max_t</i>.  Once all such events have been
executed, the command returns; the simulation time returned by
<<iref now>> will be the time of the last executed event.<p>

If there are multiple events scheduled for a particular time <i>t</i>,
they are executed in the order scheduled.  <b>TBD:</b>  Eventually,
we'll want to associate priorities with the various event types, and
possibly with specific events.<p>

Executed events are deleted from the event queue, unless they
<<iref reschedule>> themselves for a later time.<p>

<<defitem cancel {eventq cancel <i>id</i>}>>

Cancels the event with the specified <i>id</i>.  The event is deleted
from the event queue, and forgotten.<p>

<<defitem checkpoint {eventq checkpoint}>>

The bulk of the event queue's data is stored in the run-time database;
some, however, is stored in memory.  This call returns a single string
containing all of the in-memory data; it can be restored by a call to
<<iref restore>>.  This command is expected to be used by the
application's checkpoint/restore code.<p>

<<defitem define {eventq define <i>etype eargs body</i>}>>

Defines a new event type called <i>etype</i>.  In general, the syntax
of this command is similar to that of the standard Tcl
<code>proc</code> command; an event can be thought of as a proc that
can be scheduled for later execution.  The event type is
scheduled with the arguments named in the <i>eargs</i> list; when the
execution time is reached, the event's <i>body</i>, a Tcl script, will
be called with the argument values just as a proc is.<p>

<b>TBD:</b>  At this point, the <i>eargs</i> must be a simple list of
argument names; at some later time, we may support default
arguments and variable length argument lists as normal Tcl procs do.<p>

The type name and argument names must begin with a letter, and may
contain letters, numbers, and underscores.<p>

<b>Notes:</b>

<ul>
  <li> Event types may be defined before or after the
       <<iref init>> method is called.
  <li> Event bodies may be redefined simply by calling <<iref define>>
       a second time with a new body; but the argument list must be
       identical.
</ul><p>

For example,<p>

<pre>
eventq define arrival {name} {
    puts "$name has arrived!"
}

eventq schedule arrival 5 joe
</pre>

<<defitem destroy {eventq destroy <i>pattern</i>}>>

Destroys all event types whose names match a <code>glob</code>-style
<i>pattern</i>.  When an event type is destroyed, all scheduled events
of that type are deleted from the queue, and the event type's schema
entries are deleted from the run-time database.<p>

<<defitem eventcount {eventq eventcount}>>

Returns the number of events scheduled to date, including events which
have been cancelled before execution.<p>

<<defitem etypes {eventq etypes}>>

Returns a list of the names of the currently defined event types.<p>

<<defitem init {eventq init <i>db</i>}>>

Initializes the event queue, allowing events to be scheduled.  The
<i>db</i> must be an instance of <<xref sqldocument(n)>> (or the
equivalent) which defines the eventq(n) schema.<p>

Note that event types may be defined both before and after the call to
<<iref init>>.<p>

<<defitem now {eventq now}>>

Returns the event queue's current simulation time.<p>

<<defitem reschedule {eventq reschedule <i>id t</i>}>>

Reschedules the event with the specified event <i>id</i> to occur at
time <i>t</i>, which must be in the future.<p>

Note that an event can reschedule itself.  An event <i>body</i> might
contain a state machine, for example; each time the event occurs, it
can determine the new state and reschedule itself until a later time.<p>

<<defitem reset {eventq reset}>>

Resets the event queue as of the current simulation time, i.e.,
deletes all scheduled events while leaving the simulation time, the
event counter, and so forth unchanged.<p>

<<defitem restart {eventq restart}>>

Resets the event queue to time 0, deleting all scheduled events and
resetting the event counter to 0.  Note that old event IDs will be
reused in this case.<p>

<<defitem restore {eventq restore <i>state</i>}>>

Restores the event queue's in-memory <i>state</i>; the <i>state</i>
must be a value that was previously returned by <<iref checkpoint>>.
This command is expected to be used by the application's
checkpoint/restore code; note that any call to this routine must be
synchronized with a restoration of the run-time database.<p>

<<defitem schedule {eventq schedule <i>etype t</i> ?<i>args...</i>?}>>

Schedules an event of type <i>etype</i> to be executed at time
<i>t</i>, which must be a time in the future, i.e., strictly greater
than <<iref now>>.  The <i>args</i> depend on the event type; all
arguments specified for the type must be included.  See
<<iref define>> for an example.<p>

Returns the event ID of the newly scheduled event.<p>

<<defitem size {eventq size}>>

Returns the number of events in the queue.<p>

<</deflist eventq>>

<<section "SEE ALSO">>

<<xref sqldocument(n)>>

<<section "FUTURE WORK">>

The following enhancements are foreseen:<p>

<ul>
  <li> The module should checkpoint its in-memory data directly to the
       RDB.  This requires a change to JNEM's usual checkpoint/restore
       protocol, however.<p>

  <li> The <b>eventq_queue</b> table should include a pretty-printed
       copy of the arguments for each event, to make browsing the
       overall event queue easier.  Either that, or we need to define
       a view that effectively does so.<p>

  <li> The <<iref define>> command should support default arguments
       and variable-length argument lists, as <code>proc</code> does.<p>

  <li> It might be desirable to define events with large numbers of
       arguments such that each argument is a separate column in the
       <b>eventq_etype_<i>etype</i></b> table but the arguments are
       passed as a dictionary to <<iref schedule>>.<p>
</ul>

<<section ENVIRONMENT>>

eventq(n) requires Tcl 8.5 or later.

To use eventq(n) in a Tcl script, the environment variable
<code>TCLLIBPATH</code> must include the parent of the util(n)
library directory.
