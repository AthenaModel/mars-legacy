# Mars Simulation Support Library

Mars is the primary infrastructure layer for Athena and related projects.  See the docs/ directory for details.  HTML documentation is built from the ".ehtml" files as part of the build process.

This repository contains the code for Mars 1.x and Mars 2.x, which were used with versions of Athena prior to Athena 6.3; it was imported from the Athena subversion repository when Athena development moved to GitHub4Enterprise for Athena 6.3.x.
