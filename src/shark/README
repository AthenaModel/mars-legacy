shark: Extended JNEM tclsh
-----------------------------------------------------------------

shark(1) is a standard tclsh extended with JNEM-specific commands.
These commands are grouped into the following packages:

    rti(n)     RTI API binding
    shark(n)   Miscellaneous commands
    util(n)    Some util(n) commands are implemented in shark(1) 
               for speed.  Require util(n) to access them.

shark(1) may be used to run Tk applications provided that Tk is
required explicitly, e.g.,

    package require Tk 8.4
